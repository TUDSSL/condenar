Battery-free DOOM User study experiments - transcript from interview with Participant 10 - Interview date 17 July 2023 (Transcript on July 2023)

- Observations during the user interaction with the device:  
 - (a) first the user was cranking slow (during first DOOM session); only after second DOOM session the user realised she needs to crank faster; 
 - (b) we need to give time to play to the users before they start playing during the actual experiments: without that first dry gameplay, what they will play at the first session will not be representative (as the users will use it to understand how to play the game); 
 - (c) during the whole game the user was quite bored - I did not see any enthousiasm while playing the first DOOM level, only after second DOOM leven she became more engaged; 
 - (d) she finshed/"game-overed" TETRIS before 5 mins of play time so I had to restart a new game for her; 
 - (e) all experiment times was approximately 5 minutes (not exactly 5 mins, due to restarting of the console in Tetris and allowing the user to stay longer in the flow); 
 - (f) as in the case of user 8, I decided to perform the experiment with a switched off/dimmed light to remove the effect of a dark screen

- Post-experiment question to the user during interview about self-observations during the interaction with the device: 
 - (a) DOOM made her dizzy/motion sick and this is the reason she was kind of happy that during DOOM the console powered off; 
 - (b) user found playing Tetris much more enjoyable than DOOM; 
 - (c) Tetris was annoying to play because of cranking; 
 - (d) Cranking should note be used during the game at all; 
 - (e) Energy for playing game after cranking should allow to play for the duration of the entire game, i.e. one crank move of duration X - one complete game play; 
 - (f) Cranking could be used for some games, but not for dynamic ones such as DOOM; 
 - (g) Crank is making lots of noise, which is annoying; 
 - (h) Screen was visible in a dimmed light; 
 - (i) User ask how much energy is generated by solar panels (I said - not as much as the crank); 
 - (j) Tetris powered off multiple times during her game but she managed to power it through it through with cranking; 
 - (k) Good thing about console: none (as in - our console looks the same as any other console); crank is a nice extra feature to have
