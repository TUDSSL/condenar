Tasks for @acabrerizo :es: :
- replace existing cranks with robust cranks for all consoles (the ones that Jasper suggested)
- change menu for all consoles as follows:
 - Make two main menu's in Settings `/`: and name them `Experiments` (containing all menu options as they are now) and `Other (do not access during Experiments)` (containing all other existing menu options)
 - in `Experiments` sub-menu: Move `Experiment ID` to the top and rename it to `Experiment ID (set before "Start experiment")`
 - in `Experiments` sub-menu: Remove `Pause enabled` option (it must be enabled for all three experiment types so we do not need it)
 - in `Experiments` sub-menu: In `Presets` make only three menu's `Battery-powered/Crank input`, `Battery-free/No crank input` and `Battery-free/Crank input` - all three should correspond to the types of experiments as the name suggests
 - in `Other (do not access during Experiments)`: move all remaining menu's (except `Experiments`) into this new one
- Write down and share it with us a list of all parameters that are selectable in the Settings menu for each of the three Presets (for example `Battery-powered/Crank input`: `Screen brightness` = 3, `Fast CPU` = true, `Checkpoint creation enabled` = true, `Enter level episode` = 9, `Brightness` = 2, `Pause enabled` = true, etc. and add it to the repository readme
- In presets of the console: 
 - Change the default level of DOOM level 2 (instead of level 9)
 - Modify all preset to shoot with a triggers always (no matter what experiment type we are executing)
 - Rotation in Tetris with crank - remove it from all presets
- Readme:
 - explain what each of the `Settings` menu options mean and what are the possible parameters (why this is important? for example in `Settings` menu there is generic `Screen brightness` and DOOM `Brightness` - why two of them, how they affect each other? etc.)
- Changes to https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/jdewinkel/battery-free-doom repository:
 - Merge https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/jdewinkel/battery-free-doom and https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/jdewinkel/cpu-module into one with http://github.com/tudssl/condenar as the primary
 - Convert log analysis file from C# to Python and add it to the repository
 - in the repository create the following directory structure (and move respective files in the correct locations):

## Notes discussed with James Broadhead on 2 August 2023

Names of six options:
- "(1) Battery - DOOM - Tetris" -> "Battery-powered/Crank input - DOOM X -> DOOM B -> Tetris"
- "(2) Battery - Tetris - DOOM" -> "Battery-powered/Crank input - Tetris -> DOOM X -> DOOM B"
- "(3) Power Level - DOOM - Tetris" -> "Battery-free/No crank input - Tetris -> DOOM X -> DOOM B" 
- "(4) Power Level - Tetris - DOOM" -> "Battery-free/No crank input - Tetris -> DOOM X -> DOOM B"
- "(5) Connected - DOOM - Tetris" -> "Battery-free/Crank input - DOOM X -> DOOM B -> Tetris"
- "(6) Connected - Tetris - DOOM" -> "Battery-free/Crank input - Tetris -> DOOM X -> DOOM B"

Suggestions for console design improvement (ask Jasper)
- add sticker "ON/OFF" under the switch and mark which one is ON and which one is OFF
- add sticker underneath the USB logger charging port "Logger"
- add sticker underneath the USB capacitor charging port "Capacitor"
- one SD card per console

Suggestions for study protocol improvement:
- Give users the ability to play the console for 2 minutes before the exact experiment starts (it should neither Tetris nor DOOM)
- Inform the user during studies that she/he is doing something obviously wrong (e.g. not flipping the crank during cranking when taken out)
- Keep the light always turned off in all experiments
- Keep the same room for all user experiments (or keep the light intensity the same and keep the distance between the user and experimenter the same in each room)
- Measure light intensity before the start of each experiment
- Let the user restart the game her/himself when the game has reached the end within the 5-min experiment (i.e. do not restart the game ourselves)
- Make sure that the questions for us - experiment executors - are not visible for the user (have two monitors to see at what part of the survey the user is now?)
- Time for experiment should be approximate but longer than 5 minutes per game

Suggestions for survey text:
- Screen "Battery-Free Game Console Experiment": remove "Ensure device capacitor is full before handing console to participant"
- Screen "Battery-Free Game Console Experiment": add "Did you take the voucher?"
- Screen "Battery-Free Game Console Experiment": add "Researcher Page" and add color
- Screen "Researcher Page": Add "Battery-Free Game Console Experiment" to the title
- Screen "Researcher Page": Change the names of each of the six options to the same both in the (a) survey, (b) console (c) text description
- Screen "Researcher Page": Remove options about charging 
- Screen "Researcher Page": change "Which order are the participants following?" to "Experiment option"
- Screen "Researcher Page": adjust text to the left or center for "Enter the participant ID code"
- Screen "Researcher Page": add text in red "Please pass the PC to the participant"
- Screen "Background questions": capitalise the title
- Screen "Background questions": change the gradation of questions in "On average, how frequently do you play video games?" (because "Rarely" is actually "A few times a month")
- Screen "Background questions": add images to each type of the game, including the last question ("Have you ever used a handheld device powered by harvested energy sources")
- Screen "Background questions": change "played the video game Tetris" to "Tetris"
- Screen "Device Introduction and Tutorial": add description of what each of the button does (as for example "left trigger" means nothing) - the description should be connected with the actual game play
- Screen "Device Introduction and Tutorial": regarding "Powering the Device" - this text does not apply to "Battery-powered" version. What to do here?
- Screen "Device Introduction and Tutorial": photo needs to change after a new crank version
- Screen "Device Introduction and Tutorial": add section about playing with the device for few minutes: how are we going to organise this?
- Screen "Tetris Introduction": replace an image with a screenshot from an actual device and map button presses to the elements on the image
- Screen "Tetris Introduction": add description about using the crank to rotate tetriminions
- Screen "Tetris Game Experience 1": "When interrupted" - but it does apply only to battery-free cases: how does it apply to battery-powered version?
- Screen "Tetris Game Experience 1": add labels to intermediate answers for easier processing
- Screen "Tetris Game Experience 2": remove number on top of the slider or add (1) and (21) at extremes
- Screen "DOOM Game Introduction": "Doom interface" - explain the meaning of each symbols on the screen
- Screen "System Evaluation": "Enjoyed all games equally" - what if the user liked another subset of games? Use select instead
- Screen "System Evaluation": "indicate your level of agreement" - add labels to intermediate answers for easier processing

- Add description about taking the proper paper sheet for the experiment

- General question: what is the session expiry time (I just got a "We are sorry but your session has expired." message)

Questions to James:

- Where to store the data?
- What is your availability between now and november?

Questions to Alejandro:
- Is the data analysis script added to GitHub
- How will we know which part of the log corresponds to which game?
- Why there are six presets and not three?
- What is "Pause enabled" in "Experiments" section of the menu?
- What is "GBC"?
