# Folder structure

Most folders here are self explanatory, but there are a few notes:

- MicroSDLogs: Logs extracted directly from the logging modules, no processing done in them.
- LogProcessing: Python script that processes all the logs it finds in a "RAW" subfolder, removing empty parts and providing key metrics such as interaction percentage.
