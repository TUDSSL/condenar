# 3D files
You can use any 3D CAD program of your choice to open and modify the .step files. Any .stl files can be also directly sent to the slicer for 3D printing.

## Buttons
ButtonNormal.step: A/B/X/Y buttons.

ButtonPower.step: The power button. It is special because it is sloped down and can't rotate.

ButtonTrigger.step: Trigger buttons. These buttons need to be carefully adapted to the 3D printer being used to print them since they require very strict tolerances.
	
## Enclosure
The enclosure is split into 2 pieces, Enclosure_Top.step, and Enclosure_Bottom.step
The top part is the one with the holes for the buttons, joystick, and screen.

## Enclosure_Bottom.step
This is the bottom part of the console enclosure.

## Crank
The crank is made out of 3 pieces: CrankBase, CrankHandle, and Crank Bottom.

The best way to print each of the parts of the crank (for maximum strength) can be seen in the picture below:

Preliminary study cranks have been printed using Cura 5.3, using the default profiles, with 100% infill.
